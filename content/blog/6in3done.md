I'll be honest, it was fun. I learnt quite abit about both frontend and backend development but more importantly, I finally understand how a website works. Alot of breadth over depth, probably due to the time factor, but who's to say thats a bad thing. Looking forward to go deeper into the frontend when I have the chance to.

## Laguages and Frameworks (Learnt and used)
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- React
- Bootstrap
- Tailwind
- Python
- Django
- SQLite
- Git

Overall, happy I decided to try this out.

On to the next, let's see what happens from here.
