I have a couple of weeks till the start of school.

Thought I would spend it learning and practising something new. Full Stack Web Development seemed like a good next step.

### What I plan to do:

The plan is to create 9 websites/components within the next 4 weeks, with close to no Web Development experience. They'll mostly be project ideas stolen from OpenCourseWare (eg TheOdinProject, FreeCodeCamp). I was slightly hesitant about this at first, but I realised ability must come before creativity.

### My current state:
- Elementary proficiency in Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

### What I hope will happen:
- Intermediate proficiency in Backend Frameworks, which currently just look like buzzwords. This is the highest priority. 
- Intermedita proficiency in Frontend Frameworks, notably ReactJS, Bootstrap and Tailwind.

### Schedule
As a little promise to myself, I'll pen down my ideal day for the next few weeks. For memory's sake.

- 0500 - 0600: Wake Up
- 0600 - 1200: Work
- 1200 - 1230: Lunch
- 1230 - 1700: Work
- 1700 - 1800: Dinner
- 1800 - 2100: Work
- 2100 - 2200: Chill

More or less an impossble schedule to follow, but aim for the stars and you'll land somewhere high i suppose.

Unsure what will happen, but I'm sure I'll be learning alot.
