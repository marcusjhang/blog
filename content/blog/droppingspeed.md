Was hesitant to put this up, but decided to do so for acountability sake. 

The past week was not a good one. Had alot of trouble sticking to schedule and commiting to what I had set out to do. Allowed my schedule to be overrun by outside commitments and this was the result, could say I had a mini burnout as well. 

I set high expectations for the next couple of weeks and painfully learnt that with increased speed, there will be a dip in consistency and vice versa. I guess it's more important to balance these two rather than completely bank in on one (or ignorantly believing both are possible at the same time).

Anyways, just a short check in on how I'm doing and hopefully a reminder to myself in the near future. Dropping my speed for now. Consistency first.
