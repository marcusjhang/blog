I have exactly 8 weeks till the start of school.

Thought I would spend it learning and practising something new. Full Stack Web Development seemed like a good next step.

**What I plan to do:**

It's pretty self-explanatory, but the plan is to create 16 websites/components within the next 8 weeks. They'll mostly be project ideas stolen from OpenCourseWare (eg TheOdinProject, FreeCodeCamp). I was slightly hesitant about this at first, but I realised ability must come before creativity.

**My current state:**
- Intermediate proficiency in Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
- Elementary proficiency in ReactJS and Bootstrap.

**What I hope will happen:**
- Increased proficiency in Backend Frameworks, which currently just look like buzzwords. This is the highest priority.
- Increased proficiency in Frontend Frameworks, notably ReactJS, Bootstrap and SASS. 
- Exposure to miscellaneous things like Software Testing and Authentication. Things I will unlikely use until I start to work.

Unsure what will happen, but I'm sure I'll be learning alot.
