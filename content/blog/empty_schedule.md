Procrastinated writing this for a few days.

I kept most of my schedule empty so that I could work on shit I felt was important. But now I find myself constantly looking forward to the next activity. Most of my time alone is not spent well. Not optimal.

I have about one month left till school starts, so I've been thinking hard about what I should do till then.

Leetcode? Prepare for school? Web Development? Pick up a new skill? Interested in learning about product management as well.

Not sure honestly. Thinking of working on my java and more front end development. Those are my weak points as of now. 

Looks like it's settled. Leetcode in Java, and more Front End Mentor.

**Schedule**

Again, I'll put this here as a goal for myself to look towards.

- 0500 - 0600: Wake Up
- 0600 - 1200: Leetcode
- 1200 - 1230: Lunch
- 1230 - 1700: Front End Mentor
- 1700 - 1800: Dinner
- 1800 - 2100: Front End Mentor / Prepare for School
- 2100 - 2200: Chill

Let's see how this goes.
